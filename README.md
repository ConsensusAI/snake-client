# Snake Client Project

Based on the famous Snake game, where you play as a snake that eats food and grows in length. The goal is to grow it to become as big as possible without bumping into the side walls, or bumping into itself, upon which it dies.

This is simply a multiplayer take on the genre.

Before you can run this client, you will need to be running the server side which you can download and install from here: https://github.com/lighthouse-labs/snek-multiplayer
